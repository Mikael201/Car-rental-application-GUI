Creating a desktop application GUI for car rental:
A desktop application GUI for car rental built with Java. The application is keeping track of the company's cars, which are reserved and which are free. Always when closing the application, all the reserved/free cars are stored in separate notepad files. One notepad file for tracking the reserved cars, one notepad file for tracking the free cars. After relaunching the application again, the data is uploaded from the notepad files into the application: Reserved cars are still reserved, free cars are still free.
